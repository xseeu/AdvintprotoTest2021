        <h1>Week03_What do Prototypes Prototype?</h1>
        <h3>"Once a prototype has been created, there are several distinct audiences that designers discuss prototypes with."</h3>
        <p> The prototype is essential for a design team. In the group, it might include interaction designers, a programmer,
            and a project manager. Different people have different expectations on the prototype, which might lead to
            misunderstanding and false expectations. In this circumstance, the prototype should emphasize the overall structure.
            The demonstration of how the prototype "looks and feels," the "role" it plays to solve the user's problem, and how 
            this system works will be the critical guideline to build the final product.  Based on the different types of the prototype,
            the designer also needs to decide on the resolution(amount of detail) and fidelity (closeness to the eventual design).</p> 


            <h3>"Look and feel prototypes are built primarily to explore and demonstrate options for the concrete experience of an artifact."</h3>
        <p> This type of prototype is called "look and feel", which directly helps both the user and team member understand how the final product will be looked like and how
             to interact with it. Although it might not solve the user's problem directly and demonstrate the functions accurately, a quick 
             visualization and various possible feelings can provide the design team's probable direction. The advantages of this prototype 
             also include that it starts with a simple user interface design, which can be developed without having first to implement complex
            and expensive technology. 
            </p> 


            <h3>"Some prototypes are built primarily to answer technical questions about how a future artifact might ctually be made to work. "</h3>
            <p> Implementation prototypes are more advanced that "look and feel" prototype because it requires demonstrating the actual function
                 and what technology can achieve it. These implementation prototypes help the design team evaluate their technical feasibility 
                 and get feedback from users on performance issues. If the current technology cannot implement this function, the design team needs
                  to figure out another solution. After this prototype, the design team will have the confidence to build an integration prototype
                   that displays an artifact's complete user experience. 
                </p>
