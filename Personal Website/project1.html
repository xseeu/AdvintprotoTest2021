            <h1>Week01_The Starry Night Diagram</h1>
            <h3>- Why did you decide to work on this topic, what's your interest there?</h3>
            <p> I am always interested in astronomy and fascinated by evening scenery, 
                so I decide to use them to be my topic background. Instead of designing 
                an educational tool, I would like to create a little game. So my user can 
                enjoy the romantic scenery without too much stress. I believe that the imitation 
                of the astronomical operation mode of the game will impress my user.
            </p> 

                <h3>- How did you envision your system in the beginning and how did that vision change?</h3>
                <p>  I plan to design earth that always rotates on the bottom. The user can control the shooting 
                star to jump up and down to hit the target star in the sky. To make the game more exciting, 
                I will also count the principle that the user hits. However, my diagram from the first week 
                does not show the coding system very well. So I recreate a second system that detailly describes 
                the relationship between the user (user), earth, and target(star). My vision does not change much 
                from the beginning, but I think I might change my design style after looking at the example on the 
                openprocessing.
            </p>


            <h3>- How did you translate your diagram into code?</h3> 
            <p> I first insert the background image that I already created in Photoshop, and then 
                I make a circle as my earth. The earth's rotation can interact with my shooting star, 
                so I decide to add the rotation later. Users can press the keyboard or use the mouse 
                to control the shooting star move up or down. When it hits the end, the new shooting 
                star will pop up. When a shooting star hits a star, the next star will automatically 
                appear. On the main page, I set the start number will always be five. There are two 
                counters; the first one is 60 secs timing, and the second one is counting how many stars that user hit.
            </p>
            
            <h3>- How did you deal with the complexity in your system?</h3>  
            <p> I encountered several problems during my coding process. It is hard for me to make the
                 user hit a star, and then the star disappears. The disappeared star will transfer to a
                  point, and then a new one pops up. This logic seems simple, but I can not put them down 
                  as codes. So I watched the tutorial to get more understanding and then find a similar 
                  system example online. I utilize its logic and rewrite base one existed coding, which 
                  is a lot easier than take a start from the head.
            </p>

            <h3>- How did you decide on the interactive elements?</h3>  
            <p> The main interaction elements focus on user and target. When the user controls the 
                shooting star, they have the chance to hit the target star. Once the user hits it,
                 it will get one point. I also make the earth rotate clockwise along with the shooting 
                 star. All these interactions will create an exciting and fun game.
            </p>

            <h3>- What would be some paths for future development of the project?</h3>  
            <p> I would like to make different styles and make the earth rotate. Maybe after 1 min,
                 the rotation will become faster. The star that the user did not hit will turn out
                to be the black hole chasing the user. These small elements will make the game experience more enjoyable.
            </p>
