            <h1>Week01_The Starry Night Diagram</h1>
            <h3>- Why did you decide to work on this topic, what's your interest there?</h3>
            <p> I am always interested in astronomy and fascinated by evening scenery, 
                so I decide to use them to be my topic background. Instead of designing 
                an educational tool, I would like to create a little game. So my user can 
                enjoy the romantic scenery without too much stress. I believe that the imitation 
                of the astronomical operation mode of the game will impress my user.</p> 
            <h3>- How did you envision your system in the beginning and how did that vision change?</h3>
            <p>  I plan to design earth that always rotates on the bottom. The user can control the shooting 
            star to jump up and down to hit the target star in the sky. To make the game more exciting, 
            I will also count the principle that the user hits. However, my diagram from the first week 
            does not show the coding system very well. So I recreate a second system that detailly describes 
            the relationship between the user (user), earth, and target(star). My vision does not change much 
            from the beginning, but I think I might change my design style after looking at the example on the 
            openprocessing.</p>
